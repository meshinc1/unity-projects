# Shape Match Game

### Project Objective

To design and implement an interactive 3D puzzle game which relies on a quick reaction time in order to score as many points as possible.

### Introduction

The goal when creating this game was to gain a deeper understanding of the Unity game engine and its potential, while having the chance to be a little creative.

The premise of the game is simple. Every few seconds, a wall of tiles with a cut-out shape approaches a platform with a puzzle piece resting above it. The player must 
manipulate the puzzle piece by interacting with their keyboard in order to align the piece with the cutout in the wall. The player is able to switch between four puzzle
piece shapes and move and rotate the piece within an invisible 4x4 grid.

As the wall of tiles continue to emerge from the fog, the player's objective is to prevent the puzzle piece from making contact with the wall for as long as possible. 
Should any part of the puzzle piece not fit through the cutout in the wall, the player loses.

The shape, position and orientation of the cutout in the wall is selected randomly with each instance; no two rounds are likely to be identical, thus the player cannot
rely on memorization to advance through the level.
